### Hackathons

I wanted to improve my creative skills during hackathons, coming up with new and interesting ideas that would solve problems with very simple solutions. Working in a startup environment allowed me to have more freedom when it came to coming up with ideas and how we built them up which was amazing because it taught me so much about ideation, design, testing and market fit. I was able to place 2nd In both of our hackathons which was a great feeling and excited me to do more outside of work.7

### Presentations

Improving my ability to present is vital for working in companies big or small. Over the course of the semester I made it a goal to work on my presentation skills to my fellow co-workers and other members of the company. By doing so I would have a great advantage over others who may have never presented making it easy to get my ideas across and just over all being more confident in a presentation setting. Every week we would have to come up with a presentation to see what we have been working on during the week to keep the team updated. We also had to prepare a big presentation for middle manage to show what the innovation sector was working on and allowed us to connect with other people in the company to make our products a reality.

### Big Data and DDOS Mitigation

During the course of the semester I worked closely with the security team to enforce security and help use their DDOS mitigation solution Arbor. Arbor tracks and logs over 20,000 packets every second on the ORION network and all this information is stored for later analysis. Using Libraries such as Pandas to test hypothesis and tools such as Hadoop the team and I were able to filter specific packets that were malicious. By doing this we reduced down time and server load significantly.

My primary role at ORION was to work with network teams to evaluate and use the various tools supplied by ORION such as their SIEM and Arbor to generate statistical insights and transparency. Alongside assisting the various teams and departments in the specification of and development of customized software tools as required. 


The most unique aspect of this job was the diversity of projects and keeping all of them on track and manageable. I had to develop excellent time management skills which I already possessed from school. The Software Design courses that I have taken in year 1 and 2 have been extremely helpful in preparing me for 


## Conclusions

Overall the experience was great. It taught me a lot about managing time, keeping on top of tasks and providing quality work that I can be proud of. I’m very proud to work with Big data to develop statistical models that have helped and will continue to help ORION’s network run smoothly in the future. Working with many different and diverse teams gave me insights into were their problems lie and helped me understand how to better suit their needs. ORION is a great company and gave me a lot of freedom to develop and strive and would love to work with them again in the future.
